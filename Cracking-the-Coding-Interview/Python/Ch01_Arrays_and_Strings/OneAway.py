'''
One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings:
insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character.
Give two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit(or zero edits) away.
Example:
pale, ple -> true
pales, pale->true
pale, bale-> true
pale, bake -> false
