Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrom.
A palindrom is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. 
The palindrom does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. 
You can ignore casing and non-latter characters.
